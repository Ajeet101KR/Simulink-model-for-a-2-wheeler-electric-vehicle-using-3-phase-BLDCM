# Simulink-model-for-a-2-wheeler-electric-vehicle-using-3-phase-BLDCM
This repository is for the organization of the MATLAB Simulink model for a 2-wheeler electric vehicle using 3-phase BLDCM optimization.
This repository consists of 2 MATLAB Simulink models of which one is a simple Simulink model for an electric vehicle using a DC motor drive, and the other one is a MATLAB Simulink model for an electric vehicle operating on 3-phase BLDC motor drive.
